This is an important thing to note in IPv4, because
the same concept can be applied to IPv6, and it helps to
understand this with the much more familliar v4s.

- In this case, it is 256 addresses (not really, there
  are special addresses as well)

* IPv6 Notation

** IPv6 Notation

- We start off with 128 bits.  writing them in 8 bit chunks just is silly

* Compact Form
- You can remove at most one set of contigious zeros
- You don't write your age in forms as 0031 right?

* Compact Form (Quiz)

It is ambigious, I don't know how many zeros to put in
each group

* Packet

Total Length vs Payload Length

- Total Length: IPv4 is the Total Packet Length (inc header)
- Payload Length: IPv6 is only the payload length.
  There is important because IPv4 has a variable length header.
  IPv6 doesn't.

Time To Live:
- was supposed to be milliseconds, it was always
implemented as hop count (miliseconds are expensive)
- IPv6 changed this

Protocol vs Next Header, tells you what protocol (TCP vs UDP),
just a new name

- IPv6 Doesn't have room for more options.

* Assignment

Uses the prefix fe80::/64, NDP finds other nodes on the network,
finds the routers and DNS and can determin the address prefix

it populates the lower 64 bits with the modified EUI-64 which is taken
from the mac address

- There are secure forms of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol ( _Secure_ Neighbour Discovery Protocol)

* Private Networks

Really low chance of collisions

   The following table shows the probability of a collision for a range
   of connections using a 40-bit Global ID field.

      Connections      Probability of Collision

          2                1.81*10^-12
         10                4.54*10^-11
        100                4.54*10^-09
       1000                4.54*10^-07
      10000                4.54*10^-05

   Based on this analysis, the uniqueness of locally generated Global
   IDs is adequate for sites planning a small to moderate amount of
   inter-site communication using locally generated Global IDs.

* DNS

Simply because the `A` record *MUST* be an IPv4, you can't
reuse it for IPv6, so the `AAAA` record was created, which
functions in exactly the same way

* Tunneling
