Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses rfc4193

The Local IPv6 addresses are created using a pseudo-randomly allocated
global ID.

They have the following format:

| 7 bits |1|  40 bits   |  16 bits  |          64 bits           |
+--------+-+------------+-----------+----------------------------+
| Prefix |L| Global ID  | Subnet ID |        Interface ID        |
+--------+-+------------+-----------+----------------------------+

Where:

  Prefix                  FC00::/7 Prefix to ID Local IPv6 unicast
                          addresses.
  L                       Set to 1 if the prefix is locally assigned.
                          Set to 0 may be definde in the future.
  Global ID               40-bit global identifier used to create a
                          globally unique prefix.
  Subnet ID               16-bit subnet ID is an indentifier of a
                          subnet within the site.
  Interface ID            64-bit Interface ID as defined in [ADDARCH]

This results in:

     Prefix  Global ID     Number of          Prefixes    % of IPv6
             Length        /48 Prefixes       per Person  Address Space

    /7        41         2,199,023,255,552    236         0.781%


These are considered *globally* unique, which, with the probability
of collisions is extreemly low ( 10000 different Global IDs networked
results in `4.54*10^-05` chance of collision), you don't need to
worry about merging networks.  Routing between these has to be
explicit, the contract with the router is that these are *local*
addresses, and can only be linked explicitly.
